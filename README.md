# Version_Control

I created 3 branches in Bitbucket.   
1, master  
2, main  
3, test-branch  

When I created pull request in Bitbucket, there was an issue that I can't merge master and main. So, I merged main and test-branch.   

From TestPypi, I published the python package to GitHub. However, I don't see it in GitHub.    
The below is the link of my Python package.  
https://test.pypi.org/project/kaedeaki/  
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ kaedeaki
